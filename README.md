# MyReads

MyReads is a book tracking app that allows users to select books and categorise them into three shelves: currently reading, want to read, or read. This project is built using React and makes use of the [BooksAPI](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/) provided by Udacity. Try out the app [here](https://nd-myreads.herokuapp.com/)!

## Search terms

The [BooksAPI](https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com) is limited by a particular set of search terms found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](https://github.com/andyhsh/udacity-myreads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md). They are the only search terms that will return a result.
